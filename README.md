Full Pipeline Integration: Cross-Validation + Train/Test spli + Standardzation.

# Machine Learning Pipeline
This project demonstrates the integration of all previous steps into a complete Machine Learning pipeline. A pipeline is a streamlined workflow that combines preprocessing (standardization) and modeling (logistic regression) into a single object, ensuring reproducibility and preventing data leakage.

- Python 3.12
- pandas
